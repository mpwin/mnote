# Mnote

A personal tool designed to help me with learning new things, self-quizzing, and recalling old things. It works by randomly selecting an entry from a list of notes and displaying it in a tkinter app window. Notes can feature text, images, shuffled quiz items, and hidden answers that are revealed when clicked.
